# Advent of Code

This repo contains my solutions to the daily puzzles of
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/). They are not optimized for
speed, readability, nor code size, but for speed of implementation.

`aoc_to_slack.py` is a quick hacky script for posting the standings of a private
leaderboard to a slack channel.
